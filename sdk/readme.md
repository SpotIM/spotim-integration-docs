# Mobile SDK

Mobile SDK enables publishers of all sizes to significantly boost audience engagement, drive traffic, and earn meaningful revenue across mobile apps. Our community solutions are available to the public in a native SDK so that iOS and Android mobile app developers will now have the ability to monetize user-generated content (UGC) via revshare.
