## Comments

Add the following code in the themeâ€™s functions.php file, if the embed method is set to `Replace WordPress Comments`. It will append it to post content but not replace the WordPress Comments, you've to manually disable the WordPress comments.
```php
if ( method_exists( 'SpotIM_Frontend','display_amp_comments' ) ) {
    add_action( 'ampforwp_after_post_content', function() {
        SpotIM_Frontend::display_amp_comments();
    }, 10 );
