# Before You Begin
Know your site's content, brand and audience before picking Spot IM widgets. Understanding these traits may guide whether you need a live blog for covering developing stories, anonymous commenting for increased user privacy, extra moderation for taboo topics and more.

Before using Spot.IM you will need your Spot.IM `Spot ID`. This is a personal identification for your site or sites. <br>
Each article displaying Social Kit - conversation and/or recirculation - will also require a `Post ID`. <br>


# Login Flow
Publishers can choose between three unique login systems. Each login system provides tokens authenticated by Spot network IDs. This means users may be automatically logged in if they have previously logged in on the Spot network on their browser. 
* Email Connect - Users login using an email and password, entered on the Spot IM widget. 
* Social Connect - Users login through external networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and MSN.
* Single Sign On (SSO) - Users login directly through the Publisher. User information passes from the Publisher to widgets. 


# Silo and Non-Silo Spots
Publishers have a choice to create their own network or use the Spot IM community network. 


# Best Practices (General)
* Publishers are given a Staging and Production Spot ID in order to fix any potential bugs or UI-issues prior to going live. Test widgets using your Staging Spot ID, on staging websites, before integration into production sites.
* Decide on community guidelines and work with Spot IM to uphold them. Publishers decide if they want to enable anonymous postings, flag toxic words, turn on/off commenting for Live Blogs and much more.
