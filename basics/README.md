# Before You Begin
Before using Spot.IM you will need your Spot.IM `Spot ID`. This is a personal identification for your site or sites. <br>
You will need to create a `Post ID` for each article or page that you want to display Social Kit on.

## Best Practices for Creating Post IDs
Publishers are given a Staging and Production Spot ID in order to fix any potential bugs or UI-issues prior to going live. Test widgets using your Staging Spot ID on private, staging websites, before integration into production sites.
