# Reactions
Empower your readers to express how they feel. Reactions opens the door to a more spontaneous, emotional engagement with your content.Spot.IM’s Reactions functionality opens a native environment to engage readers when they decide to engage - and only then, to expose them to advertising, assuring you’ve got their attention. Talk to your assigned PSM if you have additional questions. 

## Implementation Instructions
First, notify your PSM that you are interested in setting up reactions. A monetization campaign will be set up for you. 
Next, Enable Article Reactions in your admin panel. You can choose to enable on all articles or manually choose which articles you want to enable on.

Next, determine where you would like your reactions widget located. Currently we have two options:

#### Above Conversation Widget
This is the default location that is located above your conversation widget
#### Manual Integration
You also have the capability of manually adding a line of code to wherever you want the widget to load
```html
<div data-spotim-app="reactions" data-spot-id="sp_qaNXmDxI"  data-post-id=“INSERT_YOUR_POST_ID”></div>
```

You can next set your title. This is the default title that will show up for your widget. You have the option to individually adjust the title page by going to the article page and editing the title if you have admin privledges.

Lastly choose the reactions that you want to load. Reactions are customizable by name and order. You must choose at least two reactions.

### Customizing Reactions Per Article
You have the ability to customize reactions based on a per article basis. First go to the article page and make sure you are signed in as an admin or journalist (moderators do not have this capability). 

Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the reactions widget. You have the capability to:
1. Disable Reactions for this article. Users no longer see Reactions, while admins continue seeing a disabled version.
2. Enable Reactions (whether previously disabled or default off)
3. Edit the title to a custom value, or revert it back to your Spot's default
4. Reset your own vote total to zero.
