# Community Pages
Community Pages are category pages mixed with the best of what social media offers. Many publishers have category pages that amalgate articles so you are able to read everything in one place. This is great for the user that wants to deep dive into a particular topic. Community Pages takes this experience to the next level.

1. Community Pages provide unique, custom widgets that allows the reader to interact with other readers. This interaction create online fandoms specific to the topic. You can deep dive into great content AND discuss what you are reading about with fellow fans.

2. Community pages allow you to create content around content! This new user generated content is independent of the news cycle driving user loyalty because relationships revolve around the topic. 

3. Community Pages are unique because you allow users a fandom with your site's own personal point of view. While there may be other publishers offering category pages revolving the same topic, your own custom Community Page allows you to create a fandom with your site's OWN personal point of view. 

Please contact your account manager if you are interested in creating Community Pages for your website.
