# Displaying Traffic Widget for Community Pages 
You can display a traffic widget in a Conversation page to drive traffic towards a community page 
corresponding with the data article tags set on the Conversation.

Place the following script on your page, replacing `SPOT_ID` with your Spot ID, and replacing `POST_ID` with your Post ID:

```html
<div data-spotim-module="community-promo" data-spot-id="SPOT_ID" data-post-id="POST_ID"></div>

```
