# Popular-in-the-Community
Popular-in-the-Community, or Recirculation, promotes the most popular content from your site by showcasing user-generated content (UGC). This unit drives users to more of your content and features a monetization component so you can generate meaningful revenue via revshare. You can find implementation instructions for Popular in the Community packaged with our other widgets [here](https://github.com/SpotIM/spotim-integration-docs/tree/master/social-kit)

## Standalone Popular in the Community Implementation 

To implement the Popular in the Community Widget without Conversation inject the following block of code where you would like the product to render. Be sure to replace SPOT_ID with your site's spot id. Also be sure to only include one launcher in your code as the product will not work properly with more than one. 

```html
<script async src="https://launcher.spot.im/spot/SPOT_ID"
    data-spotim-module="spotim-launcher"></script>
```
